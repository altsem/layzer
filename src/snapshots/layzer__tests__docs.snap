Layzer - A Lightweight Terminal Layout Library                                  
                                                                                
Layzer is a zero-heap-allocation layout library for building nested layouts with
 discrete positioning, and sizing. It's designed for terminal UIs, text-based   
interfaces, and any scenario where you need to compute positions and sizes of   
rectangular elements.
